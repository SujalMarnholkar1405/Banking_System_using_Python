# 🏦 Banking System Project (Beginner Python Project)

Welcome to my first Python OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) based mini-project!

This is a simple **Banking System** built using **Python classes and inheritance**. It demonstrates how we can structure real-world entities like `Person`, `Account`, `Customer`, and `BankManager` using class-based design.

## 🧑‍💻 Why I Made This

I’ve just started my Python journey and I’m learning by building small, practical projects. This is one of my first object-oriented programs in Python, and I'm using this to strengthen my fundamentals.
